Games::Console

* more accessor methods
* documentation and testsuite are still lacking
* input handling? commands? Or should this be just done outside?
* Games::Console::SDL?
* make it possible to "shift" the output, e.g. scroll through the backbuffer
  by keeping an auxilary offset at were to start rendering message lines

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
