Games::Console - draw a Quake-style console which allows input and logging

DESCRIPTION
===========

This package provides you with 2D console, which can accept user input and
display messages from the application. The console works very much like in
the popular ID games.

For some background information, as well reasoning why this was developed and
why in this way, browse to:

	http://bloodgate.com/perl/sdl/game.html

See the above URL for examples on how to use this code. The distribution
contains an example, this uses SDL::App::FPS as a framework. So you will need
SDL::App::FPS for the example, but you could also use this module stand-alone.

Prerequisites
=============

You need SDL, SDL_image and SDL_perl v1.20.3 to use this. See

		http://bloodgate.com/perl/sdl/sdl_perl.html

on how to get the latest version of SDL_perl. 

Installation
============

* untar/ungzip the package (replace 0.02 with the version you got)

	tar -xzf Games-Console-0.02.tar.gz

* Check the signature. Download my key from http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc or
  from my CPAN directory. Then do in the build directory (where you unwrapped
  stuff):

	cpansign -v

* if the signature verifies OK, proceed. Otherwise NOTIFY ME IMMIDIATELY. Do
  NOT INSTALL THE PACKAGE! Your system might get compromised!

* Build the make file:

	perl Makefile.PL

* Make the project

	make

* Run the tests:

	make test

* If some tests fail, please notify me.

* If all tests pass, install as root:

	su
	[enter password]
	make install
	exit

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
